\chapter*{Forward}

The goal for this project is to create a book that can be read cover to cover as a textbook that teaches basic math, comprehensively, leading up to introduction to calculus and analysis.

The motivation for this book is that current education in public schools in America is quite slow, and often not taught well.
I got my first experience of reading a well-written textbook in the \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/}{\textit{Art of Problem Solving}}\cite{aops} math books series, and it has transformed my life by giving me a solid math foundation that has helped me throughout my academic and technical career.
When I first picked up those books, I was reading through it and picking up the concepts super fast. It was way faster than learning in school, and I was amazed at how much I could learn by just self-studying a textbook.
I hope that this book can serve the same to you, and provide a method to learning the subject that plagues America.
