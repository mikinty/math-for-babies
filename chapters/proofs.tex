\chapter{Proofs}

While showing your work is already annoying, having to outright explain a proof seems like so much work, especially when the result already seems so obvious.
Like if I asked you if $1 + 2 + \cdots + n > 0$ for $n$ positive integers, it seems trivial because of course positive numbers will add up to be positive.
But \textit{can you prove it}? That formalization seems annoying and a lot of people seem stuck when they are asked to show mathematical results rigorously.
But the reason mathematician require such rigor is that proving a statement is making a very strong point that it is true in all circumstances. It's not like physics or other fields where we can make theories that hold until proven false (e.g. Newton's theory of gravity and then Einstein disproving it over a hundred years later).
There are some statements that seem true, but can actually seem false. That's why we require so much rigor in math.

Need to introduce basic logic.
